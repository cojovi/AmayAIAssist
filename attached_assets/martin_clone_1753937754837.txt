**Martin is a Y Combinator-backed “Jarvis-style” AI personal assistant you can call, text, email, or ping on Slack/WhatsApp; it learns your preferences and then handles the grunt work—triaging email, booking meetings, setting reminders, drafting texts, even joining phone calls—so you can move twice as fast.**([trymartin.com][1], [docs.trymartin.com][2], [Apple][3], [Y Combinator][4])

## What exactly is Martin?

* A cloud-based AI butler delivered through an iOS app (Android wait-list open) and a web dashboard.([trymartin.com][1], [Apple][3])
* Reachable on every common channel: phone, SMS, WhatsApp, email, and Slack, so you interact with it the same way you’d ping a human assistant.([docs.trymartin.com][2], [Y Combinator][4])
* Built by DCWU, Inc. (YC S23) with GPT-4-class models under the hood.([Y Combinator][4], [Capterra][5])

## What does it actually do?

| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Inbox triage & drafting**       | Labels / folders messages, summarizes threads, writes replies you can approve.                                         | ([docs.trymartin.com][6], [TechRadar][7])            |
| **Scheduling**                    | You CC martin@… and it proposes times, juggles conflicts, and drops the event on everyone’s calendar.                  | ([docs.trymartin.com][8])                            |
| **Reminders, to-dos & briefings** | Quick voice/text command (“remind me Friday 3 PM”) or automated daily/weekly email briefings.                          | ([docs.trymartin.com][9], [AI Agents Directory][10]) |
| **Calls & texts**                 | Can place calls or send messages to contacts on your behalf (think “text the team I’m running late”).                  | ([Apple][3], [KnowTechie][11])                       |
| **Proactive help**                | Over time it notices patterns and suggests actions (e.g., “You have an unread bill-pay alert—want me to remind you?”). | ([KnowTechie][11])                                   |

## Access & cost (as of July 2025)

* **Free tier** lets you try basic commands and limited email/calendar integrations.([trymartin.com][1])
* **Pro plan** unlocks background automations like full email triage and “cc-to-schedule.”([docs.trymartin.com][8], [docs.trymartin.com][6])
* iOS download is live now; Android and desktop users can use the web app while on the wait-list.([Apple][3], [app.trymartin.com][12])

**Bottom line:** Martin slots into whatever channel you’re already using and quietly picks up repetitive coordination tasks—essentially a 24/7 digital secretary that gets smarter the more you hand off.

Building a “Martin-style” assistant that lives inside Google Workspace is **totally doable**—because nearly every feature you described maps cleanly onto existing Google APIs plus an LLM layer.  Below is a pragmatic blueprint: what to use, how the pieces fit, and a lean MVP roadmap.

## 1 | Feasibility at a Glance

* **All core data lives in Google** (Gmail, Calendar, Tasks), so a single backend can access everything through OAuth 2.0 + a Workspace **service account with domain-wide delegation**.([Google Help][1], [Google for Developers][2])
* **Inbox triage, drafting, pattern-spotting** are classic LLM use-cases already proven by tools like Superhuman’s Instant Reply (built on OpenAI).([OpenAI][3])
* Scheduling logic boils down to **Calendar FreeBusy queries** and event inserts.([Google for Developers][4])
* Reminders plug into the **Google Tasks API**; no extra SaaS needed.([Google for Developers][5], [Google for Developers][6])
* Everything can run stateless on **Cloud Run** behind a REST/WebSocket API, keeping ops minimal.([Google Cloud][7])

## 2 | Reference Architecture

### 2.1 Backend Service (“Brain”)

| Layer              | Tech                                                  | Purpose                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Webhook intake** | Cloud Run (Python / Node)                             | Receives Gmail push notices, slash-commands, UI calls.                                                                          |
| **Auth**           | Service account + domain-wide delegation              | Acts on any *@cmacroofing.com* mailbox without per-user re-auth.([Google Help][1])                                              |
| **Data APIs**      | Gmail, Calendar, Tasks, People                        | Read/modify email, events, tasks, contacts.([Google for Developers][8], [Google for Developers][4], [Google for Developers][5]) |
| **LLM**            | OpenAI (function-calling) **or** Gemini via Vertex AI | Classification, summarization, draft generation, intent parsing.([OpenAI][3], [Google Cloud][9])                                |
| **Persistence**    | Firestore / Datastore                                 | Store user preferences, embeddings, interaction logs.                                                                           |
| **Real-time**      | Pub/Sub → WebSocket                                   | Push status back to the React UI.                                                                                               |

### 2.2 Web Front End

* **Next.js or Remix** with Google OAuth for user login.
* Dashboards for “Today’s triage,” pending drafts, task list, and proactive suggestions.
* You could also package it as a **Workspace Add-on** later (same code; Google renders it inside Gmail/Calendar).([Google for Developers][10])

## 3 | Feature How-Tos

#### 3.1 Inbox Triage & Drafting

1. Enable **Gmail push notifications** (`users.watch`) so the backend is pinged on new mail.([Google for Developers][8], [Google for Developers][11])
2. Pull the message, embed meta-features (thread length, sender, labels).
3. Call the LLM: *“Classify urgency, suggest label, draft 1-sentence summary & 3 reply options.”* (OpenAI works great here; keep Gemini in reserve for tighter Google integration).
4. Store results; surface them in UI and optionally auto-apply labels or drafts.

#### 3.2 Scheduler (“CC Martin”)

1. Parse inbound threads for date/time language via LLM.
2. Use **`freeBusy.query`** to check everyone’s calendars.([Google for Developers][4])
3. Pick candidate slots, create events with the **Calendar API** and send replies from `martin@cmacroofing.com`.

#### 3.3 Reminders & To-Dos

* Map “remind me …” or proactive nudges into **Google Tasks** entries.([Google for Developers][5])
* Offer quick-add in UI; optionally send Slack/Chat notifications later.

#### 3.4 Proactive Help Engine

* Nightly job runs LLM on 30-day email/Calendar metadata to spot patterns (unanswered invoices, meetings with no agenda, etc.).
* Surfaces “Would you like me to…?” cards in the dashboard.  Use Gemini if you want **native Google data-governance & PII scoping**; otherwise stick with OpenAI for maturity and model quality.([IT Pro][12])

## 4 | Security & Compliance

* **Restricted OAuth scopes** (mail.readonly vs full modify).
* Secrets in **Secret Manager**; no keys in code.
* Enable **access transparency** logs and VPC-SC if data sensitivity is high.

## 5 | MVP Roadmap (≈ 6 weeks)

1. **Week 1-2** – Set up Cloud Run service, service-account delegation, Gmail watch → log raw events.
2. **Week 3** – Implement triage classifier + draft using OpenAI; build bare-bones React panel.
3. **Week 4** – Add Calendar scheduling flow and Tasks integration.
4. **Week 5** – Proactive suggestion prototype; refine UI/UX.
5. **Week 6** – Security hardening, unit tests, internal beta.

## 6 | Why It’s Straightforward

Google’s APIs expose every artefact you need; Cloud Run handles scaling; LLMs take care of the heavy reasoning.  Strip out telephony, scope only to Workspace, and you have a lean “mini-Martin” that’s fully within reach for a small dev team—or even a motivated solo builder with your admin access and API keys.

Google Workspace **domain-wide delegation** lets a service account act “on behalf of” any user in your domain—*but only when your code explicitly tells it which user to impersonate.* You, as super-admin, grant that service account one-time authority over chosen API scopes; after that, each API call includes a *subject* value (the target user’s email). The operation then touches **their** mailbox, calendar, or tasks—not yours—and it never re-uses your personal refresh tokens or Gmail settings.([Google Help][1], [Google Help][2], [Google for Developers][3], [google-auth.readthedocs.io][4])

## 1 | What “domain-wide delegation” really means

* You create a **service account** in Google Cloud; it owns a client ID and JSON key.([Google Cloud][5])
* In the Admin console you add that client ID under **Security → API Controls → Domain-wide delegation**, listing only the Gmail/Calendar/Tasks scopes you need.([Google for Developers][6], [IBM][7])
* This skips per-user OAuth consent: the service account is now trusted to impersonate any *@cmacroofing.com* user for those scopes.([Google for Developers][8], [docs.metaspike.com][9])

## 2 | How calls get routed to the *right* mailbox

```python
creds = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    "svc.json",
    scopes=["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify"],
    subject="alice@cmacroofing.com"   # <- who to impersonate
)
service = build("gmail", "v1", credentials=creds)
service.users().messages().list(userId="me", q="is:unread").execute()
```

The `subject` field tells Google “perform this request as Alice.” If you later set `subject="bob@cmacroofing.com"`, the same credentials touch Bob’s inbox instead.([google-auth.readthedocs.io][4])

## 3 | Implications for your tests and rollout

| Scenario                                                               | Whose data is accessed?                | Why                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Local testing with `subject="you@cmacroofing.com"`                     | Yours                                  | You asked to impersonate yourself.                                                        |
| Colleague logs into the web app; backend sets `subject` to their email | The colleague’s mailbox/calendar       | Service account now acts as them. No extra keys needed.                                   |
| You forget to pass a `subject`                                         | Service account only (no user mailbox) | Gmail APIs will error because service accounts don’t own mailboxes.([Stack Overflow][10]) |

## 4 | Security & best practices

* **Principle of least scope**: grant only the exact Gmail, Calendar, and Tasks scopes—skip Drive, Contacts, etc.([Google Help][1])
* **Audit & revoke**: Admin console shows every client ID with delegation; you can remove it any time.([Affinity Help Center][11])
* **Log who you impersonate**: keep a Firestore record of user-ID ↔ subject mappings and API actions for compliance.([Unit 42][12])

### Bottom line

Your single service-account key unlocks workspace-wide access, **but only to whichever user you impersonate per request**. Once you move from your own tests to colleagues, pass their email as the `subject` and the assistant will act on *their* Gmail, Calendar, and Tasks—never yours.

**Yes – adding Slack DMs as the “ping” channel is quick work:** a single Slack bot token plus two API calls (`users.identity` → get the person’s user ID, then `chat.postMessage` or `reminders.add`) lets your backend fire personal-DM reminders at any moment you choose. All the heavy OAuth plumbing is already familiar to you, and nothing conflicts with the Google-side service-account model.

## How the Pieces Fit

### 1. One Slack app → DMs for every employee

1. **Create / reuse a Slack app** in your workspace. Give it the scopes `chat:write` (for `chat.postMessage`), `im:write` (to start DM channels automatically), and *optionally* `reminders:write` if you’d rather let Slack handle recurring reminders. ([Slack API][1], [Slack API][2])
2. During install you’ll capture a **bot token** (starts with `xoxb-…`). A single bot token can message *any* user in the workspace as long as the app is installed there. ([Slack API][3])
3. Store that token in **Google Secret Manager**; fetch it at runtime instead of hard-coding. ([Google Cloud][4])

### 2. Identifying the target user

* When a CMAC employee signs in to your assistant’s web UI, also kick off **Slack OAuth** (or ask them to click “Connect Slack”). Store their Slack `user_id` alongside their Google identity.
* If you prefer zero end-user OAuth, your bot can call `users.identity` with an admin-level user token to map company email → Slack ID, since Workspace emails usually match profile emails. ([Slack API][5])

### 3. Sending the reminder

```python
slack.post(
  "chat.postMessage",
  json={
      "channel": user_id,          # e.g. U04ABC123
      "text": "Heads-up: roof inspection with the Smiths starts in 10 min."
  }
)
```

Passing a **user ID** as `channel` automatically drops the message into that person’s DM with your bot. ([Slack API][6], [Stack Overflow][7])

### 4. Scheduling strategies

| Option                                 | How it works                                                                     | Pros                                   | Cons                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Backend timer + `chat.postMessage`** | Use Cloud Tasks / Cloud Scheduler to hit your own endpoint at due time, then DM. | Full control; supports rich blocks.    | You manage timing infra.                                                     |
| **Slack-native `reminders.add`**       | Your bot calls once: `text="Submit daily report"` `time="every day 4pm"`         | Slack tracks recurrence & sends.       | Less formatting; reminders land via @Slackbot, not your DM. ([Slack API][8]) |
| **Scheduled messages**                 | `chat.scheduleMessage` with a Unix timestamp.                                    | No extra infra; appears from your bot. | One-shot only; reschedule for repeats. ([Slack API][6])                      |

For your “quick nudge” use-case, *scheduled messages* are usually simplest.

### 5. Wiring it into the Google-side workflow

1. When the assistant writes a Google Task (due date or recurrence included) store its `task_id`.
2. A Cloud Scheduler job (or Firestore event listener) checks for due tasks every minute, converts them to Slack DMs, and marks them “sent.”
3. For proactive suggestions (“You left three invoices unread…”), generate the card, then immediately DM via the same `chat.postMessage` call.

## Security & Maintenance Tips

* **Least-privilege scopes**: stick to `chat:write`, `im:write`, `reminders:write`; skip `channels:history` or `users:read` unless later needed. ([Slack API][1], [Slack API][2])
* **Token rotation**: Slack now lets you enable automatic 12-hour rotation; if you turn it on, wire refresh logic into Secret Manager. ([Slack API][9])
* **Audit logging**: Slack’s Admin panel tracks every bot message; Google Cloud Audit logs track each secret access. Lock both down to admins only. ([Slack API][10])

## Effort Estimate

| Task                                 | Time   |
| ------------------------------------ | ------ |
| Slack app creation & scopes          | 30 min |
| OAuth / identity mapping             | 2–3 h  |
| Cloud Task → Slack DM lambda         | 3–4 h  |
| UI toggle (“notify me via Slack”)    | 1 h    |
| Testing (token rotation, edge cases) | 2 h    |

So, **a single developer can bolt Slack DMs onto your Google-centric assistant in less than a day**, re-using the solid Workspace foundation you already laid out.
